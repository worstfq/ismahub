Hey ðŸ˜º IsmaHub is my small project currently it supports only Forsaken. However i plan to expand it on more games.

## The ONLY and REAL IsmaHub loadstring is

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worstfq/ismahub/refs/heads/main/306407c6ab943b2c.lua"))()

```


## Current features

 - Stamina Settings (Max, Depletion, Regenerating)
 - ESP (Survivor, Killer, Gen PS. Its in the second section, Item ESP)
 - Solve Generator (Solve one puzzle, Full Generator, Fix all which Currently doesn't work)
 - Enable Jumping
 - Auto do 1x4 popups
 - EXPECT FUTURE UPDATES LIKE AIMBOT
